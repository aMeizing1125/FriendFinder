FriendFinder Homework

What the project does?
It is like a basic eHarmony where you can match up with people based on your response to the questionnaire 

Why the project is useful?
It was useful because it tested my skills in folder management, routes, modules export, node and express. 


Where users can get help with your project? 
hmm... try the internet.. perhaps Google it. Always a great response. 


Who maintains and contributes to the project?
